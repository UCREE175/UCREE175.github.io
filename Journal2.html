                                    <p>The first parts list I wrote down were not specific enough. I quickly realized that it was very hard to follow my parts list and some issues were quickly brought to my attention. The amplifier I designed did not work, and we realized later that jfets are preffered with low noise amplifiers.
									Which made more sense to start from scratch while maintaining the general components. The second component parts list we decided on were more specific and realized they were too specific. Since those parts were harder to work with and in the end we did not achieve the linear gain we wanted. I learned that there has to be a balance of organizing a parts list that are not too specific or broad. Since the first was too hard to follow and the second was so specific that it was to hard to design. Also, it was hard to debug when the gain was not achieved. Lastly, the final design part was an agreeement between our whole team, it clearly was simple to follow with the Pspice that David had designed. (Note-Attach a Pspice diagram in the future)   </p>

									<h2>Issues</h2>
									1.Not including a Pspice, and the diagram I delivered was too specific.
									<br>
									2. Parts list was either too specific or too broad.
									<br>
									3.Some parts were obsolete and or unavailable 
									<br>
									4.Alternative pieces were not exact to the specifications that i sent from the specific diagram. Caused alot of issues.
